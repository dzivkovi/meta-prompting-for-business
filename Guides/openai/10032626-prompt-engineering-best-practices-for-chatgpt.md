This guide provides resources to help ChatGPT users craft effective prompts for high-quality responses.
# What is a prompt? 
A prompt for a Large Language Model (LLM) is a text input that initiates a conversation or triggers a response from the model. However, it can be in other forms such as an image or audio.
# What is prompt engineering?
Prompt engineering is the process of designing and optimizing input prompts to effectively guide a language model's responses.
# General best practices
## Be clear and specific 
Ensure your prompts are clear, specific, and provide enough context for the model to understand what you are asking. Avoid ambiguity and be as precise as possible to get accurate and relevant responses.
## Iterative refinement 
Prompt engineering often requires an iterative approach. Start with an initial prompt, review the response, and refine the prompt based on the output. Adjust the wording, add more context, or simplify the request as needed to improve the results.
## Requesting a different tone
Use descriptive adjectives to indicate the tone. Words like formal, informal, friendly, professional, humorous, or serious can help guide the model. For instance, "Explain this in a friendly and engaging tone."

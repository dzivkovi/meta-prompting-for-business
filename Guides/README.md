# Official Prompting Guides from Major AI Model Providers

## Deep Research on Prompting Guides

**User**: Google just released a prompt engineering guide. It was authored by Lee Bonster and has 68 pages. It was released end of April 2025. And people are talking that other cloud, actually other AI model vendors, have similar prompting guides. But there is so much noise on the internet that I cannot locate them. Ideally, I would want to have them in PDF format if officially published, but other formats are okay as well. I'm specifically interested in Anthropic prompting guide, and I know that OpenAI has 4.1 prompting guide, but it's available as a Jupyter notebook and only addresses one specific GPT version, GPT-4.1. So please let me know where I can find official versions of the model providers' prompting guides.

**ChtGPT**: Great. I’ll gather official prompting guides released from 2024 onward by major AI model vendors such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Cohere, Meta, and Mistral. I’ll prioritize PDF documents but will include HTML pages or GitHub repositories if no PDF is available. I’ll focus on verified sources to avoid unofficial or noisy material.

I’ll update you once I have a complete list with download or access links for each guide.

| **OpenAI**        | *Prompt Engineering* (OpenAI API Documentation)        | OpenAI (docs team)           | Dec 2023 | HTML (Web) | [OpenAI Prompt Engineering Guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering)                                            | OpenAI’s official documentation includes a **Prompt Engineering guide** covering best practices for crafting prompts. It emphasizes giving clear instructions (often at the start) and using examples or delimiters to format tasks. Key tips include using the latest models, specifying output formats, and structuring prompts (instructions, context, examples) to steer responses. In essence, it walks developers through techniques (system messages, few-shot examples, JSON outputs, etc.) to elicit accurate and focused outputs from GPT models.                                                                             |

The document includes many examples and best practices for interacting with Google’s Gemini/Vertex AI models, such as how to format instructions and use examples to improve accuracy. It is intended for developers working with Google’s LLMs in production.                                                                                    |

It focuses on defining success criteria and using prompts (vs. fine-tuning) to achieve them. The guide explains that prompt engineering is a fast, cost-effective way to improve model behavior compared to fine-tuning. It gives advice on designing prompts to meet specified goals and notes when other approaches (like switching models) may be more effective. The overview emphasizes clear objectives, iterative testing, and examples to refine Claude’s outputs according to user-defined metrics.                              |
| **Mistral**       | *Prompting Capabilities* (Mistral AI Docs)             | Mistral AI Docs team         | 2024     | HTML (Web) | [Mistral Prompting Capabilities](https://docs.mistral.ai/guides/prompting_capabilities/)                                                 | Mistral’s official docs contain a **“Prompting Capabilities”** guide demonstrating how to write prompts for common tasks. It walks users through examples for **classification, summarization, personalization, and evaluation** using Mistral models. Each section shows a user prompt (system + user message) and the expected assistant response. This helps developers see effective prompt structures for different use cases (e.g. categorizing support tickets, summarizing text) when using Mistral’s LLMs.                                                                                                                     |

It emphasizes that good prompts are **“clear, concise, specific, and include examples”**. The guide covers techniques such as using headers or delimiters (e.g. `## Instructions`) to separate parts of the prompt, providing context and example inputs/outputs, and specifying structured outputs. It also discusses “do’s and don’ts,” controlling length, and how to begin the completion to guide the model. In summary, it provides step-by-step tactics for writing prompts that yield desirable Cohere model outputs. |
| **Alibaba Cloud** | *Best practices for prompt engineering* (Model Studio) | Alibaba Cloud (Model Studio) | Feb 2025 | HTML (Web) | [Alibaba Prompt Engineering Guide](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/model-studio/use-cases/prompt-engineering-guide)                 | Alibaba Cloud’s Model Studio docs include **“Best practices for prompt engineering”** (Feb 2025). It advises using structured frameworks (e.g. **CO-STAR:** Context, Objective, Style, Tone, Audience, Response) to make prompts effective. For example, it shows how adding background (“Context”) and a clear task (“Objective”) leads to higher-quality outputs. The guide provides concrete examples of “before/after” prompts using CO-STAR, and tips on clarifying goals, style and format to get better responses from Alibaba’s LLM services. This ensures prompts are thorough and precise.                                    |

## Note

Please note that ChatGPT did not find the latest version Google prompting guide from April 2025. It was also authored by [Lee Boonstra](https://www.leeboonstra.dev/), but resides on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/whitepaper-prompt-engineering). That version (`v7`) was copied into this repo.
